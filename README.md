Submarine Terror (alpha v0.1)
======================

Simple HTML5 game built with Quintus Engine. My very first attempt at game development using tutorials, the Quintus documentation and Google+ group. Still has a lot work left. 

The primitive Atari2600-like graphics are currently just placeholders until I came up with something else.


## How to Play / Features

- Download the directory and run 'index.html' file in your browser. 
- Move left and right to dodge enemy fire and use 'space' to shoot.
- Works in mobile browers on touch devices.
- Currently works best in Google Chrome.

## TO-DO

- Add a splash screen.
- Add levels and difficulty.
- Add score.
- Replace placeholder graphics.
